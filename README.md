# MazeRunner
An educational project to realize a maze generator and to learn the A* algorithm.

Basically this program generates a maze and finds the way out. You can play with the code for a better understanding of its working and you can enjoy yourself watching it.

The algorythms used for this project are based on the relative projects from CodingTrain.
